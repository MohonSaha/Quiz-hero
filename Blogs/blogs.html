                <p>All of these methods are called array iteration methods. These are operate on every array item.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium  mb-2">map()</h2>
                    <p>The map() method creates a new array by performing a function on each array element. It does not
                        execute the function for array elements without values. This method does not change the original
                        array. Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array
                        but whats makes it unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.</p>

                    <p>Function forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate through
                        array items. This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for example, an array of
                        objects with a lot of entries than just an array of integers.</p>

                    <p>Function filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the assigned
                        condition. This function returns an array of found results, if any, even if only 1 match is
                        found. If a function does not find any match, it simply returns an empty array. </p>

                    <p>Function find() is also a search function like the filter() but they differ in one small detail â€”
                        this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the
                        function will return the first that has matched.</p>

            <div class="ml-12">
                <p> JavaScript provides three mechanisms for storing data on the client - cookies, session storage, and
                    local storage.</p>
                <article class="my-4">
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium  mb-2">Local storage</h2>
                    <p>It is a web storage method that helps us store data on the client's computer in the form of
                        key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless the
                        user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user closes the
                        window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless the browser's memory is
                        cleared.</p>

                <article class="mb-4">
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Session Storage</h2>
                    <p>It is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main difference lies in the lifespan as it
                        persists in the browser until its current tab is on. Once you close the tab or terminate it, the
                        data on session storage also gets lost.</p>

                    <p>Cookies are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported
                        by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is
                        not sensitive, such as user preferences.</p>

                <article class="my-4">
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium  mb-2">Event loop :</h2>
                    <p>In JavaScript, the event loop is a fundamental part of the language runtime that manages the asynchronous execution of code. It's responsible for handling the processing of events and the scheduling of tasks in an efficient manner. The event loop works by continuously checking the queue of tasks that need to be executed, prioritizing the ones that are most urgent or have been waiting the longest. It executes each task one at a time, and if a task takes too long to complete, it may pause execution and move on to the next task in the queue.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">How event loop works :</h2>
                    <p>The Event Loop has one simple job - to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.</p>
